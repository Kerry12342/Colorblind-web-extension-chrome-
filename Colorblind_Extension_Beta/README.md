# Colorblind_Extension_Beta

### Beta version of the Chrome extensions that provides assistance for people with colorblindness and visual impairments. 

###The extension makes user interaction incredibly straightforward and takes little-to-no learning to use. Set
at the top right corner of the page, a green box with the text “Color Blind Options” contains all of the
functions in the extension. When pressed, a larger menu appears that contains 9 buttons and 3 sliders. The
first 4 buttons contain the features “Save Preset”, “Load Preset”, “Toggle Black and White Theme”, and
“Revert Images.” The next buttons are the different color-blind modes, and the final button resets all of
the options. To the left of each button is a number, which I will get into shortly.
Below the buttons are the sliders that control the R, G, and B values of images. These sliders allow users
to fine tune the images to their liking, as each of the sliders increase the amount of that color in the image.
The entire user interface is also accessible via the keyboard as well! By pressing the spacebar, the user
can toggle the extension menu. As mentioned before, each setting button has a number next to it, and
when the user presses that key on their keyboard, that button will be pressed. For the sliders, by pressing
R, G, or B on the keyboard, that “color mode” will be activated. Then, by pressing the + and - keys
(technically the = and - keys), the user can increase or decrease the associated color’s slider by 20.
